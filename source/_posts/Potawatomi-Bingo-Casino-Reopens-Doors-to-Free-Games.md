#  Potawatomi Bingo Casino Reopens Doors to Free Games

After a one-month hiatus, Potawatomi Bingo Casino reopened its doors to the public Monday with free games. The casino closed in late May after allegations of money laundering and other illegal activities.

"We are thrilled to be able to offer our guests complimentary games once again," said Potawatomi Bingo Casino spokesperson Jackie Chase in a statement. "We apologize for any inconvenience our closure may have caused and we appreciate our guests' continued support."

Free games will be available on all gaming floors from 10 a.m. to 2 a.m. daily. In addition, the casino is offering a $10 match play bonus for loyalty club members from now until July 4th.

In May, the Wisconsin Department of Justice raided the casino, accusing it of money laundering and other illegal activities. Six people were arrested as a result of the raid, three of whom were casino employees. No charges have yet been filed against the casino or its employees.

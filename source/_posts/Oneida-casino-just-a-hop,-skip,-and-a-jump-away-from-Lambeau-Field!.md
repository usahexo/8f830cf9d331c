#  Casino offers Gehrig's disease support group

When faced with a debilitating disease, it can be difficult to find the right support group. Many people feel alone and isolated when battling a chronic illness. However, one casino is hoping to change that by hosting a support group for those living with Gehrig's disease.

The group will meets every other Wednesday night at the casino. The meetings will be led by a medical professional, who will offer support and advice to those in attendance. The goal of the group is to provide a safe space for people to share their experiences and learn from each other.

Gehrig's disease is a rare neurodegenerative disorder that affects the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. It causes muscle weakness, difficulty speaking, and problems with movement. There is no cure for Gehrig's disease, but there are treatments available that can help improve quality of life.

Those who attend the support group will have access to information on clinical trials, new treatments, and resources available in their community. They will also be able to connect with others who are living with Gehrig's disease, which can be invaluable during tough times.

If you or someone you know is living with Gehrig's disease, please consider attending the support group at the casino. It could make all the difference in the world.

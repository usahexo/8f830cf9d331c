# How do I know if a free slot game is safe to play?

Knowing whether a slot game is safe to play is not as difficult as it may seem. There are a few basic things you can look for to help ensure that the game is fair and will not cost you more money than you intended to spend.

One thing to watch for is how the casino operator is licensed. The best operators are licensed by gaming commissions in respected jurisdictions, like the United Kingdom or Gibraltar. If an operator is not licensed, it is best to avoid playing at their site.

Another indication of a safe and fair slot game is the presence of independent auditors. These auditors check the software used by casinos for fairness and randomness. If you see an auditor’s seal on a casino’s website, then you know that the game has been checked for fairness.

Finally, be sure to check out online reviews of any casino before playing there. Other players can give you some valuable insights into how trustworthy and fair an operator really is.

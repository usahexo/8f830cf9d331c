#  Flamengo suffers huge upset in Champions League

Flamengo, one of Brazil's biggest clubs, suffered a huge upset on Wednesday night as they were knocked out of the Champions League by Swiss side FC Basel.

It was always going to be a difficult tie for Flamengo, but few would have predicted them to lose 5-2 on aggregate.

Basel were the better team over the two legs and fully deserved their place in the last eight of the competition.

For Flamengo, it is another major setback in what has been a disappointing season so far. They are languishing in mid-table in Brazil's Serie A and now look unlikely to win any silverware this year.

The defeat will also come as a huge blow to new manager Mauricio Barbieri, who only took charge of the club last month.

He will now be under pressure to get Flamengo back on track and mount a challenge for the title next season.

#  Neymar leads Flamengo to first league title in 37 years

Brazilian superstar Neymar led Flamengo to their first league title in 37 years on Sunday, scoring the decisive goal in a 2-1 victory over underdog Vasco da Gama.

The 28-year-old Neymar, who left Barcelona for a world record fee of 222 million euros ($264 million) in 2017, has been the driving force behind Flamengo’s title charge this season. He finished as the competition’s top scorer with 27 goals.

Flamengo last won Brazil’s Serie A championship in 1983 and had not even reached the final since 2009.

#  Flamengo fires manager after string of poor performances

# Club president claims coach "was not able to identify the right players for the team"

# Chelsea manager Antonio Conte has been linked with the vacant position

Just a week after firing their Sporting Director, Flamengo has parted ways with their manager, Reinaldo Rueda. The decision comes after a string of poor performances, including a 3-0 loss to Cruzeiro over the weekend. Club president Eduardo Bandeira de Mello released a statement saying that "the coach was not able to identify the right players for the team and change our trajectory." 

Antonio Conte has been heavily linked with the vacant position, and there is speculation that he may already be in Brazil meeting with club officials. The former Juventus and Chelsea manager is said to be interested in taking over at Flamengo, who are one of Brazil's biggest clubs.

#  Flamengo extends unbeaten streak to record-breaking 22 matches

Flamengo continued their unbeaten streak to a new Brazilian record of 22 matches with a 0-0 draw against Cruzeiro. The last time Flamengo lost was back in September, ending a run of 21 unbeaten games.

Their current streak has seen them rack up 16 wins and 6 draws, scoring 47 goals while conceding just 15. Flamengo are now 8 points clear at the top of the Brasileirão table, and they will be looking to extend their lead even further in the coming months.

One of the main reasons for Flamengo’s success has been their attacking trio of Gabriel Barbosa, Bruno Henrique and Lincoln. The three players have combined for 24 goals this season, with Barbosa leading the way with 10 goals.

Henrique has also been in great form, scoring 7 goals in his last 9 matches. As for Lincoln, he has been impressive since his arrival from Bahia in January, scoring 5 goals in his last 7 matches.

 Backup striker Pedro recently suffered a hamstring injury which is set to rule him out for around 4 weeks. This could give an opportunity to either Paolo Guerrero or Vitinho to start up front alongside Barbosa and Henrique.

Ronaldo de Assis Moreira (“Ronaldinho”) is another player who has been important for Flamengo this season. The 37-year-old has made 12 appearances so far this campaign, scoring 2 goals and providing 5 assists. Ronaldinho’s experience and ability to create chances for his teammates has been crucial for Flamengo.

With the likes of Ronaldinho, Gabriel Barbosa and Bruno Henrique in the team, it is no surprise that Flamengo are currently on such a long unbeaten run. They will be looking to continue this excellent run of form as they bid for their first ever Brasileirão title.

#  Newcomer Diego scores winner as Flamengo edges out rivals

RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil - Diego scored the only goal of the match early in the second half as Flamengo edged out bitter rivals Botafogo 1-0 in an exciting contest at the Maracana Stadium.

It was a nervy first 45 minutes, with both sides having chances to take the lead, but it was Diego who made the decisive intervention just after the restart.

The midfielder collected a pass from Vizeu on the edge of the area and curled a delightful shot past goalkeeper Rogerio Ceni and into the bottom corner.

Botafogo battened down the hatches after that and created a few chances of their own, but they couldn't find an equalizer as Flamengo held on for victory.

The result moves Flamengo up to third in the table, while Botafogo stay in seventh place.

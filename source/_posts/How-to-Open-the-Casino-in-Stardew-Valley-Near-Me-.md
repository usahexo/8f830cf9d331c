Your progress in each of these machines is tracked separately, so feel free to switch around between them as you please. Third, there's no real reward for winning at the casino except for bragging rights—so try not to get too upset when you lose!

4. He will offer to loan you the money Interest-Free for 10 days. Say yes.

5. Take the 10 day loan from Clint, and then save your game again.

6. Now that you have the loan, go talk toLewis at the Stardew Valley Fair and enter into a bet with him for $5,000 (or more if you like). Lewis will always accept any bet of $5,000 or more.

7. After winning the bet from Lewis, save your game one final time and then open the casino!

#  Benfica to Open Casino in Hugo, MN

The Benfica Corporation, a subsidiary of the European-based Benfica Group, has announced plans to open a new casino in Hugo, Minnesota. The new casino will be the first in the state and is expected to create hundreds of jobs.

"We are excited to bring our world-class gaming experience to Minnesota," said Carlos Lopes, CEO of the Benfica Group. "This casino will be a flagship destination for the region and will provide a much-needed economic boost to the area."

The Hugo casino will be a 100,000 square foot facility with over 1,200 slot machines and 48 table games. It will also offer several restaurants and bars, as well as a luxury hotel with more than 200 rooms.

Construction on the casino is scheduled to begin this fall and it is expected to open in early 2020.

#  Benfica to Put Hugo, MN Casino on Hold

It has been rumored for a while that Benfica was looking to open a casino, and that it would be in the city of Hugo. This week, officials from the club confirmed that the project is moving forward, but there is one big hold up: the city of Hugo has yet to approve the license.

The potential casino has been a divisive issue in Hugo. Some feel that it would be a great addition to the city, while others are worried about the potential negative impact on the community. Mayor Randy Werden has not taken a position on the casino, but he says that the City Council will likely make a decision in the next few weeks.

If the casino does get approved, it will be a major project for Benfica. The club estimates that it will cost $40 million to build, and that it will create over 100 jobs. It is unclear whether or not construction will begin immediately if the license is granted, but club officials say they are eager to get started.

Benfica has been interested in opening a casino for some time. In 2017, the club submitted an application for a license to operate a casino in Cedar Rapids, but withdrew its application later that year. It is believed that Benfica decided to pursue a license in Hugo because of its proximity to Des Moines.

Casinos have become increasingly popular in Iowa in recent years. There are now nine casinos in the state, and they generate over $1 billion in revenue each year.

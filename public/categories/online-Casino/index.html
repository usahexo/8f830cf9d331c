<p>How to Play European Roulette</p>
<p>European roulette is one of the easiest casino games to learn how to play, making it perfect for beginner players. The game is played on a table with 37 numbered slots – 36 numbers and a green zero. Players place bets on where they think the ball will land after the spinning wheel comes to a stop. Once all bets are placed, the dealer will spin the wheel and release the ball. The player who has put money on the number or colour that the ball lands on will winnings based on their bet size. If betting on red or black, for example, players will only win if the ball ends up in a red slot (not including zero).

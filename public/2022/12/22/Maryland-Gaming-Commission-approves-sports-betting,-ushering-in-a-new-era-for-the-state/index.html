This move makes Maryland the sixth state in the nation to allow full-scale sports betting, following New Jersey, Delaware, Mississippi, West Virginia, and Rhode Island.</p>
<p>“This is a watershed moment for Maryland and for our gaming industry,” said MGC Executive Director Michael Cryan in a statement. “We are excited to offer this new product and believe it will provide a significant boost to our casino and racing establishments.”</p>
<p>The commission has already created regulations for sports betting, which will go into effect on October 1. Under these regulations, only licensed casinos and race tracks in Maryland will be able to offer sports betting. Participants must be at least 21 years old and must place their bets inside the establishment.</p>
<p>While other states have been quick to get their sports betting operations up and running, Maryland is taking a more cautious approach. The commission has not yet decided what types of bets will be offered or what kind of advertising will be allowed. They also haven’t decided how much of the proceeds from sports betting will go to the state’s education fund or horse racing industry.</p>
<p>“It is important that we get this right,” said Cryan. “We want to make sure that we implement a responsible sports betting program that benefits all Marylanders.”</p>
<h1 id="Maryland-becomes-first-state-to-offer-legal-sports-betting-since-the-Supreme-Court’s-decision"><a href="#Maryland-becomes-first-state-to-offer-legal-sports-betting-since-the-Supreme-Court’s-decision" class="headerlink" title="Maryland becomes first state to offer legal sports betting since the Supreme Court’s decision"></a>Maryland becomes first state to offer legal sports betting since the Supreme Court’s decision</h1><p>Maryland has now become the first state to offer sports betting since the United States Supreme Court overturned a law that effectively banned the activity. The state’s General Assembly approved a measure on Monday that would allow for regulated, legal sports gambling in Maryland.</p>
<p>The bill now awaits the signature of Governor Larry Hogan, who has already voiced support for it. “I look forward to seeing the bill on my desk and signing it into law very soon,” Hogan said in a statement.</p>
<p>If the bill is signed into law, casinos and horse tracks in Maryland will be authorized to offer sports betting, with the state taking a cut of the profits. The measure passed both chambers of the legislature with bipartisan support; backers say that regulating and taxing sports betting will bring much-needed revenue to Maryland.</p>
<p>Opponents of the measure argue that it could lead to increased addiction and other social ills. But supporters say that such concerns are overblown, and that states like New Jersey which have already legalized sports betting have not seen any major negative consequences.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court’s decision in May overturned a longstanding federal ban on sports betting, opening up the possibility for states to regulate and tax the activity. Several states are currently exploring legalizing sports betting, but Maryland is expected to be one of the first to actually do so.</p>
<h1 id="Legalized-sports-betting-coming-to-a-casino-near-you-in-Maryland"><a href="#Legalized-sports-betting-coming-to-a-casino-near-you-in-Maryland" class="headerlink" title="Legalized sports betting coming to a casino near you in Maryland!"></a>Legalized sports betting coming to a casino near you in Maryland!</h1><p>Commercial casinos in Maryland will soon be able to offer legalized sports betting to their patrons. The state’s Gaming Control Board (GCB) unanimously voted on Thursday, August 9th, to approve regulations that will permit casino operators to offer sports betting as soon as September 1st.</p>
<p>This comes as great news for casino operators in the state, who have been vying for the opportunity to offer this new form of gambling. In addition to traditional table games and slot machines, many Maryland casinos are now expected to offer betting on NFL, college football, basketball, baseball, and other sports.</p>
<p>The GCB also affirmed that it will allow interstate sports wagering between Maryland and other jurisdictions that have also legalized the activity. This means that Maryland residents will be able to place bets on sporting events with casinos in other states.</p>
<p>While some legislators opposed the measure, arguing that it will lead to increased crime and addiction rates, others welcomed it as a way of generating new revenue for the state. David Trone, a Democratic congressman representing Maryland’s 6th district, believes that legalization will create nearly 1,000 jobs in the state. He stated: “It’s not only good for jobs but also good for our tax base and our schools… Allowing people to legally bet on games they love is common sense.”</p>
<p>Opponents of the bill worry that it could lead to an increase in gambling addiction rates. A 2016 study by the University of Texas found that legalized sports betting leads to a 3-5% increase in problem gambling rates. However, Leonard Goldberg of the William Hill company – which plans to offer sports betting at Maryland’s Hollywood Casino Perryville – believes that such rates are already high and that legalization will do little to increase them: “The horse is out of the barn on this issue… The percentage of people who have a problem with gambling is not going to go up because you have legal bookmaking as opposed to illegal bookmaking.”</p>
<p>Maryland is not the first state to legalize sports betting since the US Supreme Court struck down a federal ban on the activity in May. Delaware launched its sports betting operation less than two weeks after the ruling, followed by New Jersey and West Virginia. Other states are expected to follow suit in the coming months.</p>
<h1 id="Maryland-casinos-Poised-To-Start-Taking-Sports-Bets-As-Early-As-This-Week"><a href="#Maryland-casinos-Poised-To-Start-Taking-Sports-Bets-As-Early-As-This-Week" class="headerlink" title="Maryland casinos Poised To Start Taking Sports Bets As Early As This Week"></a>Maryland casinos Poised To Start Taking Sports Bets As Early As This Week</h1><p>The legalization of sports betting in Maryland is imminent, as state officials announced that casino operators could begin accepting bets on sporting events as early as this week. Democratic Governor Larry Hogan signed a bill into law in March that authorized the state’s five casinos to offer sports betting, and while regulators have been working on the final rules and regulations, they are now ready to go.</p>
<p>Casinos in the state have been gearing up for the launch of sports betting, with MGM National Harbor announcing that it will have a dedicated lounge for sports betting and Hollywood Casino Perryville unveiling a new LED video wall that will be used for displaying odds and scores.</p>
<p>In order to place a bet,<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://choegocasino.com/">카지노 사이트</a> customers at Maryland casinos will need to present valid photo identification proving that they are at least 21 years old. They will also be able to place wagers through the casino’s gaming app or by visiting a betting window.</p>
<p>The new law allows for both in-person and online sports betting, but the latter will only be available to customers who live in Maryland. Sports betting is expected to be popular among casino customers, with some predicting that it could account for as much as 10% of total revenues.</p>
<p>Dave Hoppes, executive director of the Casino Association of Maryland, said that the industry is excited about the opportunities offered by sports betting. “This has been something that our members have been looking forward to since day one and we think it’s going to be a great opportunity not only for them but for the state as well,” he said.</p>
<h1 id="Sports-Betting-Officially-Approved-In-Maryland-But-Here’s-What-You-Need-To-Know"><a href="#Sports-Betting-Officially-Approved-In-Maryland-But-Here’s-What-You-Need-To-Know" class="headerlink" title="Sports Betting Officially Approved In Maryland, But Here’s What You Need To Know"></a>Sports Betting Officially Approved In Maryland, But Here’s What You Need To Know</h1><p>On Tuesday, the Maryland General Assembly voted to legalize sports betting in the state. Maryland is now the seventh state to legalize sports betting since the U.S. Supreme Court allowed it nationwide in May.</p>
<p>So what does this mean for Marylanders? Officially, not much yet. The bill still has to be signed by Governor Larry Hogan, and regulations have to be put in place before people can start placing bets.</p>
<p>But there are a few things that Marylanders need to know about sports betting. For one, it will likely be available only at casinos and racetracks. And while you don’t need to be a resident of Maryland to place a bet, you will have to be physically present in the state in order to do so.</p>
<p>Bets can be placed on all major professional and collegiate sporting events, as well as some other events like horse racing and international soccer matches. The minimum bet will be $2, and the maximum bet will be $15,000.</p>
<p>There will likely be a tax on gambling winnings as well. The precise rate has not been finalized yet, but it is expected to be around 15%.</p>
<p>So when can we expect to see sports betting actually begin in Maryland? That’s still up in the air. It could take a few months for regulations to be finalized and for casino and racetrack operators to set up their sports betting operations. But we could see it start happening by the end of the year.</p>

Playamo Shows You!"></a>What are the Highest Hands in Poker? Playamo Shows You!</h1><p>In poker, the highest hand is the one that contains the best combination of five cards. The rank of each card is determined by its number and its suit. In poker, the rank of a card is always important, but this is especially true when it comes to the highest hands.</p>
<p>There are a few different types of high poker hands, and each one is more impressive than the last. If you want to know what the highest poker hands are, then read on for a breakdown of each type.</p>
<p>The Royal Flush</p>
<p>The royal flush is the best hand in poker, and it consists of five cards all from the same suit, with an Ace being the highest card. This hand is incredibly rare, and it’s usually only possible to get it if you have a starting hand that’s made up of four Aces or Kings.</p>
<p>If you do manage to get a royal flush, then you can expect to win a massive pot! In fact, many tournaments award this hand as their top prize. So if you’re looking to hit the jackpot, then aim for a royal flush!</p>
<p>The Straight Flush</p>
<p>A straight flush is similar to a royal flush, but instead of containing all cards from the same suit, it consists of five cards in sequence. This hand is still quite rare, and it’s usually only possible to get if you have a starting hand that’s made up of three consecutive suits.</p>
<p>Just like with a royal flush, if you do manage to get a straight flush then you can expect to win a lot of money! In fact, some online casinos even offer 1000x your bet for landing this legendary hand. So start planning your next trip to Playamo Casino today!</p>
<p>The Four Of A Kind</p>
<p>Four of a kind is another incredibly impressive high hand in poker. This hand consists of four cards of the same rank, with any other card making up the fifth and final card. This hand usually requires at least two pair in order to form, so it’s not quite as rare as some of the other hands on this list. However, it’s still pretty hard to come by!</p>
<p>If you do manage to land four of a kind during a game of poker, then you can expect your opponents to fold quickly! This hand gives you a ton of power over the table, and it can often lead to big wins. So keep your eyes peeled for four matching cards next time you hit the casino floor!</p>

<h1 id="Find-Out-What-the-Highest-Poker-Hands-Are-at-Playamo-Casino"><a href="#Find-Out-What-the-Highest-Poker-Hands-Are-at-Playamo-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Find Out What the Highest Poker Hands Are at Playamo Casino!"></a>Find Out What the Highest Poker Hands Are at Playamo Casino!</h1><p>There are ten different hands in poker and the highest one is the royal flush. This is made up of an Ace, King, Queen, Jack and Ten, all of the same suit. Straights and flushes count towards a royal flush as well. The second best hand is a four of a kind, followed by a full house, then a flush, then a straight, then three of a kind. Finally, the two weakest hands are two pair and one pair.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to play poker and want to know what the highest hands at the table are, then read on! We’ll take you through each hand in detail so that you can be sure to have the edge over your opponents.</p>
<p>The Royal Flush</p>
<p>As mentioned before, the royal flush is the highest hand in poker and it’s made up of an Ace, King, Queen, Jack and Ten, all of the same suit. This hand is incredibly rare but if you do manage to get it then you’ll be walking away with some serious wins!</p>
<p>The four of a kind</p>
<p>Next on our list is the four of a kind. This hand is made up of four cards of the same rank. So for example, if you were dealt four Kings then you would have a four of a kind. This hand is considerably more common than the royal flush but it can still win you some big bucks if played correctly.</p>
<p>The full house</p>
<p>Third on our list is the full house. A full house is made up of three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank. So for example, if you were dealt three Queens and two Aces then you would have a full house. This hand is much more common than both the four of a kind and the royal flush and so it’s no surprise that it comes in third place on our list!</p>
<h1 id="Learn-the-Highest-Hands-in-Poker-with-Playamo-Casino’s-Guide"><a href="#Learn-the-Highest-Hands-in-Poker-with-Playamo-Casino’s-Guide" class="headerlink" title="Learn the Highest Hands in Poker with Playamo Casino’s Guide!"></a>Learn the Highest Hands in Poker with Playamo Casino’s Guide!</h1><p>In poker, the strength of a player’s hand is measured in two ways - the rank of the hand and the number of cards that make up the hand. The rank is simply the order or hierarchy of the different hands, and the number of cards is self-explanatory! In this article, we will be looking at Playamo Casino’s guide to the highest hands in poker.</p>
<p>Here is a list of Playamo Casino’s top five highest hands in poker:</p>
<ol>
<li>Royal flush</li>
<li>Straight flush</li>
<li>Four of a kind</li>
<li>Full House</li>
<li>Flush</li>
</ol>
<p>To make it easier to understand, we have explained each hand below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Royal flush - This is when you are dealt consecutive cards of the same suit, all from 10 to Ace. For example, if you were dealt an Ace of Spades, a two of Spades, a three of Spades, and so on until you reach an Ace again, you would have formed a royal flush! This hand is considered to be the best possible hand in poker and can only be beaten by a royal flush in another suit.</li>
<li>Straight flush - This is when you are dealt consecutive cards of the same suit, but not all consecutive like with a royal flush. So if you were dealt an Ace of Hearts, a two of Hearts, a three of Hearts, etc., you would have formed a straight flush. A straight flush can technically also include an Ace as either high or low (e.g.: A♠ 2♥ 3♦ 4♣ 5♥ could be either high or low), but this isn’t as common.      NOTE: If two players have a straight flush at showdown (after all players have folded), then the player with the highest ranking card(s) within their straight flush will win the pot! So for example if one player has an Ace-King-Queen-Jack-Ten straight flush and another has an Ace-Two-Three-Four-Five straightflush, then the first player will win as they have higher ranking cards within their sequence!  3. Four of a kind - This is when you are dealt four cards of the same rank (e.g.: four Kings). If two players have four of a kind at showdown (after all players have folded), then the player with the highest ranking card(s) within their fourofakind will win the pot! So for example if one player has four Kings and another has four Jacks, then the first player will win as they have higher ranking cards within their sequence!  4. Full house - This is when you are dealt three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank (e g.: three Kings and two Twos). If two players have a full house at showdown (after all players have folded), then the player with Three Of A Kind will win as they have higher ranking card(s)! 5 Flush - This is when you are dealt five cards of one suit (e g.: five Spades). If two players have Flush at showdown (after all players folded), then ties are broken by comparing who has higher single card within their suited hand (so for example if one Flush had Ace high and another had King high, then King high would take first place as it’s higher than Ace high!).</li>

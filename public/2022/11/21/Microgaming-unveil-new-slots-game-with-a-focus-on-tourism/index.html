The game is set on a tropical island and promises players an immersive experience as they explore the sights and sounds of the island.</p>
<p>The company says that the game will be available for desktop and mobile devices, with players able to enjoy it across all major operating systems. In addition to the new game, Microgaming has also announced that it is expanding its range of live casino games with a new title called “Crystal Forest”. This game will offer players an authentic and realistic gaming experience, complete with real dealers and croupiers.</p>
<p>Both games are scheduled to launch in May 2018. Microgaming has not yet released any screenshots or trailers for either game, but we can expect these to be released closer to the launch dates.</p>
<p>In a statement, Microgaming Chief Executive Officer John Coleman said: “We are extremely excited to be unveiling our new Island Resort slot game at ICE Totally Gaming this year.

<p>The game is based on the Isle of Man, and takes players on an exploration of the island’s natural and man-made attractions. These include the capital city, Douglas, as well as other locations such as Peel Castle, Laxey Wheel and Sulby Cliffs.</p>
<p>The game will be available in both desktop and mobile versions, and will feature high-quality graphics and sound effects that reflect the unique character of the Isle of Man. Players can also expect to find bonus rounds and other features that enhance the gameplay experience.</p>
<p>Commenting on the new game, Microgaming CEO Roger Raatgever said: “This is an exciting project for us, as it gives players a chance to explore one of the most beautiful islands in the world.

The symbols on the reels include iconic characters from the novel such as Monkey King, Tripitaka and White Horse. There are also plenty of bonuses to be won, including free spins, multipliers and jackpots.</p>
<p>One especially innovative feature of the game is its ‘travel mode’. This allows players to travel to different locations in China and win prizes along the way. Each location offers different rewards, so it’s worth checking them all out. Players can also win generous payouts for landing winning combinations in both the base game and the bonus rounds.</p>

The new game, called Vacation Station Deluxe, will be based on the popular “Vacation Station” amusement park ride and will feature stunning graphics and exciting gameplay.</p>
<p>According to Microgaming CEO Roger Raatgever, the new game is aimed at giving players “the ultimate vacation experience”. He added that the company is expecting it to be one of its most popular titles in the coming year.</p>
<p>The tourism market is estimated to be worth trillions of dollars, making it a hugely lucrative target for gaming companies. In recent years, there has been a growing trend towards immersive and interactive casino games that allow players to explore different virtual worlds. This has been driven in part by the increasing popularity of virtual reality technology.</p>
<p>Microgaming has already enjoyed success with its VR-enabled Lucky Charms game, which allows players to enter a fantasy world inspired by Irish folklore. The company is hoping that Vacation Station Deluxe will be equally successful, thanks to its location-based gameplay and realistic graphics.</p>
<p>The game will be released in March 2019 and will be available on desktop and mobile devices.</p>

Your progress in each of these machines is tracked separately, so feel free to switch around between them as you please.

</li>
<li><p>He will offer to loan you the money Interest-Free for 10 days. Say yes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Take the 10 day loan from Clint, and then save your game again.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Now that you have the loan, go talk toLewis at the Stardew Valley Fair and enter into a bet with him for $5,000 (or more if you like). Lewis will always accept any bet of $5,000 or more.</p>
</li>

In the Mods window, scroll down until you see “Casino unlocked!” and click on the “Install” button next to it. You may be prompted to create a new save file; if so, go ahead and do so.

<p>Next, head to Pierre’s General Store and purchase a lockpick. Now, head back to the casino and unlock the door using your key. Once inside, talk to Lewis who is standing behind the counter. He will tell you about all of the different games offered at the casino.</p>
<p>To play any of the mini games at Casino, you first need coins. You can get coins by playing games at Casino or by selling crops and other items to Lewis.

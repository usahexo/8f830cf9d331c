      <h1 id="Big-Time-Gaming-announces-their-new-age-requirements-for-their-casinos-in-Sin-City"><a href="#Big-Time-Gaming-announces-their-new-age-requirements-for-their-casinos-in-Sin-City" class="headerlink" title="Big Time Gaming announces their new age requirements for their casinos in Sin City!"></a>Big Time Gaming announces their new age requirements for their casinos in Sin City!</h1><p>Las Vegas, Nevada - In a move that is seen as both a PR stunt and a genuine attempt to provide more responsible gaming options for their customers, Big Time Gaming has announced that as of September 1st, 2019, players must be at least 21 years old in order to gamble at their casino properties in Sin City.</p>
<p>The announcement was made via press release earlier this week and comes just days before the launch of their new land-based casino property, The D Resort &amp; Casino. When asked about the decision, a company spokesperson had the following to say:</p>
<p>“Big Time Gaming is committed to providing a safe and enjoyable gaming experience for all of our guests. Requiring players to be 21 years or older is one way that we can help ensure that everyone who visits our casinos has a positive experience.”</p>
<p>The new age requirement will apply to all of Big Time Gaming’s casino properties in Las Vegas, including The D Resort &amp; Casino, The Downtown Grand Hotel &amp; Casino, and The Golden Gate Hotel &amp; Casino.</p>
<h1 id="Casinos-in-Sin-City-are-getting-stricter-with-their-age-requirements"><a href="#Casinos-in-Sin-City-are-getting-stricter-with-their-age-requirements" class="headerlink" title="Casinos in Sin City are getting stricter with their age requirements!"></a>Casinos in Sin City are getting stricter with their age requirements!</h1><p>Casinos in Las Vegas are making it harder for minors to gamble. They are now carding anyone who looks younger than 25 years old.</p>
<p>This new policy is a response to pressure from the Casino Control Commission, which has been scrutinizing casinos’ practices following several incidents involving underage gambling. In one high-profile case last year, an 18-year-old won more than $1 million at the Wynn casino in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>The new age limit will be enforced at all of the major casinos in Sin City, including Wynn, Bellagio, MGM Grand, and Caesars Palace. As a result, anyone who looks younger than 25 will likely be asked for identification when trying to gamble.</p>
<p>Some tourists are unhappy with the change, arguing that it makes Vegas less fun for young people. But the casinos maintain that they are simply trying to protect their customers and ensure that everyone is playing by the rules.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how this policy affects gambling tourism in Las Vegas. If minors find it harder to gamble, they may choose instead to spend their money on other activities in the city. This could lead to a decline in casino revenues and jobs in Las Vegas.</p>
<h1 id="How-old-do-you-have-to-be-to-gamble-in-a-casino-in-Sin-City"><a href="#How-old-do-you-have-to-be-to-gamble-in-a-casino-in-Sin-City" class="headerlink" title="How old do you have to be to gamble in a casino in Sin City?"></a>How old do you have to be to gamble in a casino in Sin City?</h1><p>There is no definitive answer to this question as the age requirement to gamble in a casino in Sin City can vary from casino to casino. However, the legal gambling age in Nevada is 21, so most casinos will require gamblers to be at least 21 years old in order to gamble.</p>
<p>There are a few exceptions, however. For example, players who are 18 or older can gamble at the Sands Expo and Convention Center, and the D Las Vegas allows players as young as 18 to gamble on its premises. So it’s always best to check with the specific casino before you visit to see if there are any age restrictions in place.</p>
<p>Some casinos also allow minors (those under 21) to play certain games, such as slots or keno, while they are accompanied by an adult. So again, it’s always best to check with the casino beforehand if you’re traveling with a minor.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-the-age-requirements-for-casinos-in-Sin-City"><a href="#What-are-the-age-requirements-for-casinos-in-Sin-City" class="headerlink" title="What are the age requirements for casinos in Sin City?"></a>What are the age requirements for casinos in Sin City?</h1><p>If you are looking to gamble in Sin City, you will need to meet the minimum age requirements. The legal age to gamble in a casino in Nevada is 21. However, there are some casinos that allow those 18 and over to gamble in their facilities.</p>
<p>The minimum age requirements for casinos in Sin City can vary from casino to casino. As a general rule, most casinos require patrons to be at least 21 years of age in order to gamble in their establishment. However, there are a few casinos that will allow those that are 18 and older to gamble on the premises.</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons for the age requirement at casinos in Las Vegas. One reason is that gambling can be an addictive activity, and it is believed that those under 21 are more likely to develop a gambling addiction. Another reason is that casinos want to ensure that those who are gambling are of legal age so they can legally drink alcohol while playing.</p>
<p>If you are travelling with someone who is not of legal gambling age, there are still plenty of things for them to do in Sin City. There are many other attractions available in Las Vegas, including shows, shopping, and dining.</p>

The minimum gambling age is 21 years old, but casinos don’t typically ask for identification.</p>
